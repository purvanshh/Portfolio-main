          <h3>Hey there, üëã</h3>
          I'm <span> Purvansh </span>, a first year student pursuing <span>BSc. in CSE </span> from Bengaluru. I build websites with a focus on responsiveness, accessibility and pleasing aesthetics. Being well versed in all the key languages allows me to rapidly design, code and deploy in an organized and efficient manner. While I specialize in <span>frontend development,</span> I'm also delving into <span>backend technologies.</span> I'm all ears for <span>new opportunities</span> to create awesome software solutions. Let's team up and cook up some digital wonders together.
          <br/> <br/>
          Beyond coding, <span>I'm an artist at heart‚ù§Ô∏è</span> ‚Äì you'll often find me lost in the world of sketches and colors. I really enjoy being creative, so I like to spend my watching anime, I call that wasting my time fruitfully. It's a great way for me to unwind and tap into my non-creative side .
